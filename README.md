## IAM ###
- Users: IAM users are individuals or applications that you create in AWS to grant them access to your AWS resources.
    - long term
- Groups: IAM groups are collections of IAM users that you can use to simplify permissions management by assigning permissions to the group instead of individual users.
- Roles: IAM roles are sets of permissions that you can assign to AWS resources (like EC2 instances) or federated users, allowing them to assume specific permissions without having long-term credentials.
    - short term
- Policies: IAM policies are documents that define permissions for users, groups, or roles, specifying which actions they can perform on which resources.
    - Policies are the rules.   
    - Users, groups, and roles are who the rules apply to.
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Best Practices ###
- Do not use the root user
- Create an admin user, then create a regular user to take actions with 
  - this follows principle of least privilege and only use the account with the least amount of privilege required
- Create groups to put users into for easy reassignment of permissions 
- see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html


### Auth Methods ###
- MFA - 2 of the following
    - something you know - ie: passwords
    - something you have - ie: token/authenticator
        - security key
        - mobile auth app
        - time based on time passwords (TOTP)
    - something you are- ie: biometrics 
- Access Keys - programmatic 
    - used for CLI or other API endpoints
    - Access Key ID and Secret Key

### Permission Boundaries ###  
- Sets maximum permissions an entity can have
- Assigned to users and roles
- Even if you have a policy, the boundary will restrict the max permissions the user can have
- Helps to mitigate privilege escalation
  - ie: something who only has IAM flags could create a user and given them admin access
    - can give someone IAM Full access but add a permission boundary that says the users this user creates can only have same or lower permissions as the current user

### Evaluation Logic ###
 ![text](./images/iam/permission-logic.png)
1. explicitly deny
2. organization policy
3. resource policy
4. identity policy
5. IAm permission boundary
6. Session policy

- Requests are implicitly denied by default 
    - Root user has full access
- Explicit deny overrides any allows 


### IAM Policy Structure ###
- Everything in AWS is an api call
- Each service has a set of actions
    - example `"Action": "s3:GetObject"`
- IAM Policies are are written in JSON
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents",
                "s3-object-lambda:WriteGetObjectResponse"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
- The only effects are `allow` or `deny`
- Action - list specific operations this policy affects
- Resource - which resource these actions can be performed on
- `*` - wildcard - signifies all from this point
